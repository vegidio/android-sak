# Android Swiss Army Knife

A Gradle library where I keep my custom classes, extensions and other files that help me during the development of my Android projects.

## üß∞ Toolbox

The Swiss Army Knife is currently divided in 3 packages:

### Network

* __FlowCallAdapterFactory:__ a Retrofit `CallAdapter` to output the responses as Flow.
* __GeneralConverterFactory:__ a general class to create different Retrofit `Converter`s.
* __GraphqlFactory:__ to make GraphQL requests and process the responses.
* __RestFactory:__ to make REST requests and process the responses.
* __NetworkState:__ enum with basic states and the ability to pass data to errors.

#### Adapter

* __BigDecimalAdapter:__ a Moshi adapter to de/serialize `BigDecimal` fields.
* __LocalDateAdapter:__ a Moshi adapter to de/serialize `LocalDate` fields.
* __LocalTimeAdapter:__ a Moshi adapter to de/serialize `LocalTime` fields.
* __LocalDateTimeAdapter:__ a Moshi adapter to de/serialize `LocalDateTime` fields.

### Util

* __PrivateFlow:__ an interface that allows the creation of `PrivateStateFlow` and `PrivateSharedFlow`.
* __StringExtensions:__ a set of extensions useful for String manipulation.

### View

* __InputField:__ an `OutlinedTextField` with a few extra features set by default.
* __EmailField:__ a `InputField` with e-mail parameters set by default.
* __PasswordField:__ a `InputField` with password parameters set by default.
* __ListRow:__ a view to be used in lists with chevron and separator set by default.
* __Lottie:__ a view used to display Lottie animations.
* __OverlaidColumn:__ a `Column` with multiple overlays that change depending on a state.
* __OverlaidRow:__ a `Row` with multiple overlays that change depending on a state.
* __OverlaidLazyColumn:__ a `LazyColumn` with multiple overlays that change depending on a state.
* __OverlaidLazyRow:__ a `LazyRow` with multiple overlays that change depending on a state.
* __OverlaidLazyVerticalGrid:__ a `LazyVerticalGrid` with multiple overlays that change depending on a state.

## üé® Code Correctness

This project uses [Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) to keep the code formatted and [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) to follow best practices. The linting is done by running the command below in the project's root dir:

```
$ ./gradlew ktlintFormat detekt
```

## üë∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Building

This library is published with the help of [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#vegidio/android-sak). In order to make the library work properly, there are a few conditions that need to be satisfied:

1. Each module should use the plugin `maven-publish` and add the publishing instruction below:

```kotlin
afterEvaluate {
    publishing {
        publications {
            create<MavenPublication>("maven") {
                from(components["release"])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. If the package has only one module, the lib should be imported using `com.github.vegidio:android-sak:<version>`, but if there are 2 or more modules then the lib should be imported using `com.github.vegidio.android-sak:lib1:<version>`, `com.github.vegidio.android-sak:lib2:<version>`, etc.

3. The code in each module should __not__ be minified.

4. The `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` must target at least Java 11 (`JavaVersion.VERSION_11`).
