# Android Swiss Army Knife

An Android library where I keep my custom classes, extensions and other files that help me during the development of my Android projects.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download

This library is hosted in my own Maven repository, so before using it in your project you must add the repository `https://maven.vinicius.io` to your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    //...
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { setUrl("https://maven.vinicius.io") } // Add this line
    }
    //...
}
```

With the repository added, you just need to add the dependencies that you need to your project's `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
//...
dependencies {
    implementation("io.vinicius.sak:network:24.1.16") // Network SAK
    implementation("io.vinicius.sak:util:24.1.16")    // Util SAK
    implementation("io.vinicius.sak:view:24.1.16")    // View SAK
}
//...
```

## üé® Code Correctness

This project uses [Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) to keep the code formatted and [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) to follow best practices. The linting is done by running the command below in the project's root dir:

```
$ ./gradlew ktlintFormat detekt
```
